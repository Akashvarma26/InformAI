# InformAI
RAG Application using Frontend and FastAPI.         



InformAI is a web-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question-answering assistant built with FastAPI. It enables users to ask questions and receive contextual responses based on indexed documents. The application supports adding web links to enrich the knowledge base using FAISS for vector storage.
